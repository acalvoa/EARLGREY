To use Earlgrey only you need import the jar to your web project and start the Earlgrey Kernel in a Servlet listener in the contextInitialized event. The Earlgrey System automatically read the project structure and load the Earlgrey structures to implement a lightweight system based on services architecture with an admin console with hot configuration options.

```java
@WebListener
public class SO implements ServletContextListener, ServletRequestListener {
	/**
     * @see ServletContextListener#contextInitialized(ServletContextEvent)
     */
    public void contextInitialized(ServletContextEvent arg0)  { 
    	  Kernel earlgrey = new Kernel(arg0.getServletContext());
    }
}
